## 'Index out of range'?

ðŸ‘‰ What is an 'out of range' error?


```python
my2DList = [ ["Johnny", 21, "Mac"],
             ["Sian", 19, "PC"],
             ["Gethin", 17, "PC"] ]

print(my2DList[0][3])

- The second square bracket references item 3 in list 0. There is no item 3 as the list index only goes up to 2. Remember, everything starts at index 0.

```python
my2DList = [ ["Johnny", 21, "Mac"],
             ["Sian", 19, "PC"],
             ["Gethin", 17, "PC"] ]

print(my2DList[0][2])

```
