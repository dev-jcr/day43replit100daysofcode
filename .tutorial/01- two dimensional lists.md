# Take Your List To A New Dimension

Pay close attention, folks, because **2D lists** are basically tables.

Tables are two-dimensional data structures where we can store data both vertically and horizontally. 

Usually this means that vertical data is used for **fields** (one category - name, ID, favorite biscuit, etc.) and horizontal data is used for **records** (all the data for each category).


Behind the scenes, we see a list *inside* a list. Forget what you know about reading a table with math or geography: 'across the corridor (x-axis) first and then down the stairs (y-axis)'. 

Here, we will do row index **first** and then the column index.

## Remember...

Here's a 1D list. We have the list name as a variable, single equals to set the value, and sqaure brackets to show this is a list. 2D lists are *very* similar. 
```python
my1DList = ["Johnny", 21, "Mac"]
```

## Adding The Second Dimension

To add the second dimension, we put lists *inside* the first list.

ðŸ‘‰ Each new list has its own set of square brackets and is **separated by a comma**. This layout of code is nice to help us visualise the 2D list a a table, but...

```python
my2DList = [ ["Johnny", 21, "Mac"],
             ["Sian", 19, "PC"],
             ["Gethin", 17, "PC"] ]
```
 ...you can also lay it out like this below:
```python
my2DList = [ ["Johnny", 21, "Mac"], ["Sian", 19, "PC"], ["Gethin", 17, "PC"] ]
```
Now, let's `print` this list.

## Printing From a 2D List
*Remember, any comments about the code are written in green like this:* 
```python
#these are comments for you, the computer will ignore them
```
### the entire list
ðŸ‘‰ We can print an entire 2D list just like we do with a 1D list.  However, this will output (print) **all** of the square brackets, commas, etc.



```python
print(my2DList)

# This will output [['Johnny', 21, 'Mac'], ['Sian', 19, 'PC'], ['Gethin', 17, 'PC']]
```
### a single row
To print a single row, use a single square bracket `[]` in the `print` command.  However, you will still get all of those square brackets and commas.  

ðŸ‘‰ In this example, I'm outputting the first row (index 0) - all of the data about Johnny.


```python
print(my2DList[0])

# This code outputs ['Johnny', 21, 'Mac'].
```

### a single piece of data

The **first** square bracket references the list, while the second references the item inside that list.

ðŸ‘‰ Here are a couple of examples:


```python
my2DList = [ ["Johnny", 21, "Mac"],
             ["Sian", 19, "PC"],
             ["Gethin", 17, "PC"] ]

print(my2DList[0][0])
# This code outputs 'Johnny'. It's Johnny's name from list 0 (first square bracket), item 0 (second square bracket)

print(my2DList[1][2])
# This code outputs 'PC'. It's Sian's computing preferene from list 1 (first square bracket), item 2 (second square bracket)
```
