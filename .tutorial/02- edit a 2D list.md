### Editing a 2D List

We can edit values in a 2D list in the same way as variables and 1D lists. You just need to change the value to the new row and column index numbers.

ðŸ‘‰ In this example, Sian has joined the dark side, so we're updating her computing preference to Linux.
```python
my2DList = [ ["Johnny", 21, "Mac"],
             ["Sian", 19, "PC"],
             ["Gethin", 17, "PC"] ]

my2DList[1][2] = "Linux"
# The line above changes list 1, item 2 from PC to Linux

print(my2DList[1])
# I'm using this line to output list 1 to check that the change has happened correctly.
```
### Play around with assigning new data to the list.
