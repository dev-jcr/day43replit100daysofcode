Lots of lovely syntax errors here.  Read the code comments for each one.

```python
my2DList =  [ ["Johnny", 21, "Mac"], # No opening square bracket
             ["Sian", 19, "PC"], # Missing , between Sian and 19. Also missing , after the square bracket for this sub-list.
             ["Gethin", 17, "PC"] ] #Extra , after this sub list - the last sub-list doesn't have a comma after it.

print(my2DList[0][1])
```
